Instruction materials for my class on "Beautiful Code", including tester functions for students' code. 

"Beautiful Code" is a Splash class meant to teach high school students good coding design. It assumes very little coding experience, which means part of my job is to teach the basics of coding alongside design. The planned activities include fixing really horrible looking code, thinking about coding problems, and extra fun topics!

Please contact me if you have any questions.
